Project Title:
Prediction of iris.csv dataset for Decision Algorithm using supervised learning machine algorithm

# Problem Statement
A American waist botonical garden grow iris flowers in their labs but using biotechnology in a single tree different type of variety flower is grow.As a dataE Science Enginner find out how much accuracy is there all category content same species
